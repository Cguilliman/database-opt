| **Size**                   | Larger             | Smaller            | Moderate             | Smaller (relative to full) | Moderate to Large (depends on implementation) |
| **Ability to Roll Back**   | Yes (to full backup) | Yes (to full or specific incremental) | Yes (to full or specific differential) | Yes (to full backup + reverse delta) | Yes (to any point-in-time) |
| **Speed of Roll Back**     | Fast               | Depends on increments | Faster than incremental | Depends on the number of changes | Fast (depends on the chosen point-in-time) |
| **Cost**                   | Higher (storage)   | Lower (storage)    | Moderate (storage)   | Moderate (storage)    | Moderate to High (depends on CDP solution) |
